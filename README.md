<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Johana</h1>
<h3 align="center">Full stack developer in progress...</h3>

- 💬 About me: **Living life requires passion and a creative approach, but more than that it is about deepening empathy, which has led me to immerse myself in a process that leads me to learn how to create intuitive, equitable and engaging digital experiences that connect positively with others, where feelings and emotions flow. I'm Johana Sandoval, I like to read, listen to music and share getaways to places with breathtaking views with my small family circle. I am characterised by curiosity, empathy, active listening, as well as honesty and sensitivity towards the emotions of others. I believe that making the world a better place requires love and putting oneself in other people's shoes. Being able to collaborate closely with other teams and individuals to create user-centric solutions is my medium to long term goal to ensure that digital experiences are intuitive, accessible and satisfying for the end users, often: ourselves! Come and join me on this learning journey where I will introduce you to the fantastic world of development!**
